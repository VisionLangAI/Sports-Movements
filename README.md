# Sports-Movements

The Athlete Movement Classification Dataset is a large-scale dataset designed for developing and evaluating deep learning models that classify the movement quality of athletes during sports exercises. It contains 50,000 labeled samples equally distributed across four movement classes — Correct, Unbalanced, Overextended, and Incomplete — ensuring a balanced representation for robust training. Each record captures comprehensive biomechanical, contextual, and performance-related attributes such as joint angles, pose velocity, acceleration magnitude, balance score, smoothness index, tempo alignment, fatigue level, and accuracy score, along with contextual information like exercise type, difficulty, and athlete experience. This dataset supports research in sports biomechanics, exercise form analysis, and intelligent coaching systems, enabling movement classification, pose evaluation, and personalized feedback generation in real-world athletic or rehabilitation settings.
